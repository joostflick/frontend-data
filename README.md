# frontend-data

I left the pile of garbage I created last week behind me and started afresh on this new project.

This time I decided to use the oba wrapper made by wouter (maanlamp) which significantly improved my life (and my application).

npm start
npm run build
npm run data

# TODO:

- years in dropdown, change year to see different stats
- all languages with a representation smaller than 5% in the pie chart added together ('other languages')
- better way to display labels pie chart
